## Getting Started With Kotlin

I have set myself on a new journey, to everyday practice kotlin as a standalone language, and then later using it for android development

I am hoping to learn few new tricks, but so far from what i have seen, i am liking Kotlin

I have challenged myself to do this everyday for the next month or so, and everyday will have different topics i will try to cover, but some will be continuation from other days

### Day One
- Setting up IntelliJ
- Variables and syntax

### Day Two

#### Control Flow
- IF
- WHEN
- FOR
